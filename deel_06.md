# Part 6: Adding the hiking route to the map

For this part, you'll find explicit instructions here.

Instead, make use of the [MapLibre GL JS documentation](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) and the [MapLibre Style Spec documentation](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/).

---

- [ ] Add `wandeling.json` GeoJSON source and add a line layer so the hiking route appears on the map.

---

- [ ] Look up what options are available for line layers. Also look up what **expressions** are and how you can use them to interpolate properties between zoom levels.

Play with the end result until you're satisfied.
